Most prediction markets, like those 
available on the industry standard Intrade.com are implemented 
like equity markets. That is, buyers and sellers interact through 
a continuous double auction. However, a number of other designs have been suggested and
gained traction. The major alternative are market scoring rules (\cite{hanson2003combinatorial}, \cite{hanson2007logarithmic}).

This format starts with a simple scoring rule - which rewards
a single person for the accuracy of his or her prediction - 
and allows other entrants to essentially purchase the right 
to the reward when they believe they have a more accurate prediction.
This format is used largely to reduce speculation and 
deal with problems that arise from thin markets. 

However, like standard scoring rules, market scoring rules 
require a market maker to subsidize the reward for accurate predictions.
