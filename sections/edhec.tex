\section{Connecting the Dots: An EDHEC Climate Institute Initiative}

- Upper level: CRUCIAL Lab initiative for higher level forecasting of climate risks
- Lower level: Financial materialization of climate risks for assets

ERCI has developed an unmatched expertise in probabilistic forecasting of climate risks.
This expertise can be leveraged to create a new generation of prediction markets for climate risks.

\subsection{Rewarding Forecasting Expertise Developed at ERCI}

Prediction Markets rewards the best forecasters, and ERCI has developed a
unique expertise in probabilistic forecasting of climate risks.

\subsection{Going Down to Asset-Level: Graphical Market Maker (GMM) for Climate Risks}

Lack of liquidity in climate risk markets at asset level, multiple events that
may affect the same asset, and the need for a continuous market maker to provide
liquidity and price discovery.

Bayesian nets -> leverage works from
Connecting the dots between ERCI's expertise in probabilistic forecasting and
new ECI initative about green assets methodologies

\subsection{A New Generation of Climate Ratings}

Ratings that relies on the aggregation of predictive markets for climate risks
at asset level.

\subsection{A New Generation of Climate-Related Securities}

Climate-related securities that are based on the probabilistic forecasts of
climate risks at asset level. Offer an hedging instrument for climate risks.
